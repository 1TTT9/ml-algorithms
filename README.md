- k nearst neighbors  
-- An implementation of kNN algorithm using sklearn.datasets  
-- Also, a practice to k-largest selection question by using randomized selection algorithm  
-- [reference](http://blog.cambridgecoding.com/2016/01/16/machine-learning-under-the-hood-writing-your-own-k-nearest-neighbour-algorithm/)  
-- Main steps are described as belows  
> 1. calculate dist. between any two points  
> 2. find the nearest neighbors base on their pairwise distance  
> 3. majority vote on a class labels based on nearest neighbors list
